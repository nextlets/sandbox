# Deployment Architecture

# Local deployment
Local deployment is used mainly for purposes of developers for developing and debugging. Local development can be performed independently of OS, however **Regent** team recommends perform deployment under `Linux` (just this way was good tested).

Because Regent is a set of microservices, the most easy way to deploy Regent locally is to run all Regent components on your local machine. But it's not a strong requirement, just a good advice.

Also Regent team recommends to use `Docker` as container of Regent components, to install Docker please follow [Docker installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/ubuntulinux/).

**:warning:** Hereinafter all examples are provided for Ubuntu Linux (or based on Ubuntu, Linux Mint for example).
